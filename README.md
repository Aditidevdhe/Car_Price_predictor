# Car_Price_predictor

**Project Overview**

This project aims to predict car prices using a linear regression model. A Chinese automobile company is looking to enter the US market and wants to understand the factors influencing car prices in the American market. By analyzing various independent variables, the model helps determine significant factors affecting pricing and provides insights to optimize business strategies.

**Business Problem**

The goal is to develop a predictive model that:

Identifies significant variables affecting car prices.

Accurately estimates car prices based on these variables.

Provides insights for automobile manufacturers to refine their design and pricing strategies for the US market.

**Dataset**

The dataset consists of various car features collected from market surveys across the American automobile industry. The independent variables include specifications such as:

Car brand and model

Engine type and horsepower

Fuel type and mileage

Car dimensions and weight

Market category

**Technologies Used**

Programming Language: Python

Libraries:

numpy - Numerical computations

pandas - Data manipulation and analysis

matplotlib & seaborn - Data visualization

scikit-learn - Machine learning models


**Methodology**

Data Preprocessing

Handled missing values

Encoded categorical variables

Scaled numerical features

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualized relationships between features and price

Identified key variables influencing car prices


**Model Building**

Applied Linear Regression

Used statistical analysis to evaluate feature significance

Model Evaluation

Achieved an accuracy of 83.4%

Analyzed residual plots to validate assumptions

Results and Insights

Engine power, fuel type, and car brand were found to be key predictors of price.

The linear regression model demonstrated a strong ability to predict car prices with 83.4% accuracy.

These insights can help the automobile company strategically design and price their cars for the US market.
